1.A user can create a new job posting by providing a title, description, and their email address. The user should also be able to specify the required skills and experience level for the job.
2.A user can view a list of all current job postings, filtered by required skills and experience level.
3.A user can view the details of a specific job posting, including the title, description, required skills, experience level, and email address of the person who created the posting.
4.A user can apply for a job posting by providing their name, email, resume, and a cover letter. The cover letter should be in Markdown format.
5.A user who created a job posting can view a list of all the applications for that job, including the name, email, and cover letter of the applicant.
6.The application should be built using Node.js and Express, and should persist data using a MongoDB database. It should expose a RESTful API for clients to access the job postings and applications.
